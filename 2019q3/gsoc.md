The FreeBSD Project is pleased to have participated in
Google Summer of Code 2019 marking our 14th year of participation.
This year we had six successful projects:

XXX do we have more information on any of these? Each should really have their
XXX own quarterly submission
 * *Dual-stack ping command* by Ján Sučan
 * *Firewall test suite* by Ahsan Barkati
 * *Kernel sanitizers* by Costin Carabaș
 * *MAC policy on IP addresses for FreeBSD Jail* by Shivank Garg
 * *Separation of ports build process from local installation* by Theron Tarigo
 * *Virtual memory compression* by Paavo-Einari Kaipila

We thank Google for the opportunity to work with these students and hope
they continue to work with FreeBSD in the future.
